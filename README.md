# My contribution to the Frontend Challenge by Natural Cycles

This app lets you chose a date and time and assign a title to show a countdown timer to the
specified date and time. Look at my demo of the app here:

## Running the app

Run `npm i` in project root Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Optional goals

1. Write suggestions of how this solution can be improved. Describe what the next steps would be in
   order for this app to be production ready. To take this app to the next level, it should be
   possible to create multiple events with CRUD options. The events should be displayed in a list,
   and when an event is clicked, that event should fill the screen like todays solution where it
   should be possible to edit the event details, and there should be a button to go back to the list
   view.
